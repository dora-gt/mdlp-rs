This file doesn't contain any output file names in its file name.

So, you have to specify in code blocks like the following:

```rust example1-1.rs
fn main() {
	println!("Hello literate programming.");
}
```


```rust example1-2.rs
# You can speficy multiple files.
```

Explanations go here.

```rust example1-2.rs
# You can even specify multiple blocks with the same file name.
```

You can export multiple files.

```json example1-3.json
{
    "json": true
}
```

```bash example1-4.sh
#!/bin/sh
echo example1-4.sh
```
